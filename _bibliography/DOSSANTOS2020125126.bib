abstract = {We investigate the vibrational energy dynamics in classical nonlinear lattices with correlated random masses following a Fractionary Brownian motion sequence with power law spectrum proportional to k−α . In the absence of cubic interaction (the harmonic limit), we numerically demonstrate the existence of ballistic energy propagation at the limit of strong correlations (α>2). Calculations were done using numerical solution of the Hamilton’s equations. When the cubic nonlinear interaction is added to our model, computation reveals the possibility of solitonic modes at the limit of strong correlations.}
